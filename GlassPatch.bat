echo First, we'll need you to choose which variant of Discord you have.

echo If you're unaware, Discord has 4 versions publicly available; Stable (the one most people will have) PTB (useful as a backup client) and Canary (you'll use this if you have Powercord). The 4th version is Developer, and as far as I'm aware, no client-mods support it, so there's no support for Glasscord.
